1–3 sentences: what’s the problem, what you did, and what impact it has  
- Link to key paper(s)
- Link to repo or data, if applicable

- **Previous role** – Role, Institution, Dates  
  - Bullet or two that’s legible to industry (e.g., “Built X, used by Y teams”, “Developed end-to-end data pipelines for…”).
